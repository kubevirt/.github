Community Code of Conduct
=========================
We want to keep the KubeVirt Community a great place to participate, but we need your help to keep it that way.

The KubeVirt community is made up of a diverse mix of individuals using and contributing to all aspects of the project from all over the world, and we want to make sure that the community is a safe and friendly place for everyone.

As a CNCF project, KubeVirt and its community abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md).

Should you encounter a violation of this Code of Conduct, please report it to the [KubeVirt Maintainers private email alias](mailto:cncf-kubevirt-maintainers@cncf.io).  If the CoC violation involves a member of [the Maintainers](https://github.com/kubevirt/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md), please escalate the report to [the CNCF Conduct staff](mailto:conduct@cncf.io).  All reports will be kept confidential.
